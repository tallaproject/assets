# Talla's Name and Logo

The idea behind Talla's name and logo comes from the following:

1. Talla's name comes from the Latin language and means a "layer of an onion",
   which is one of the concepts used in an onion routing network.

2. The lambda symbol as a replacement for the first 'a' in the name 'Talla' is
   there to represent Church's Lambda calculus, which have had an important role
   in the theoretic foundation of functional programming over the years. Erlang
   is a functional language, so the lambda symbol deserves a prominent spot in
   the logo.

3. Each of the circles represents one of Tor's directory authority servers (as
   of 24/3 2016). This gives us a backdoor in the logo design to come up with a
   better design in case there is added or removed a directory authority in the
   Tor network. We do not have to make use of this backdoor, but it is an open
   possibility :-)
